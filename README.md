## ðŸ“– Abstract
Accurate segmentation of insulated pipelines is essential for automated inspection and structural analysis in complex industrial environments. While UAV-based visual inspection is increasingly adopted, current systems often struggle with cluttered scenes and rely heavily on manual interpretation.  

This paper proposes **Region-Aware Guidance Training (RAGT)** for pipeline segmentation, a novel and modular deep neural network (DNN) training framework designed to enhance the performance and deployment readiness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) real-time region segmentation models in cluttered industrial settings.  

RAGT integrates two complementary components:  
- **Region-Augmented Knowledge Distillation (RAKD):** Guides the model to focus on task-relevant regions.  
- **Background-Aware Augmentation (BAUG):** Improves generalization by increasing background diversity during training.  

Both modules can operate independently or jointly within the unified RAGT framework. Experiments demonstrate that RAGT achieves improvements of **up to +8 mIoU** in challenging segmentation tasks.
